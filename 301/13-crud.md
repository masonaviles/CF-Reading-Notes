## Sending form data
Once the form data has been validated on the client-side, it is okay to submit the form.

### Client/server architecture
At it's most basic, the web uses a client/server architecture that can be summarized as follows. a client (usually a web browser) sends a request to a server (most of the time a web server like Apache, Nginx, IIS, Tomcat, etc.), using the HTTP protocol. The server answers the request using the same protocol.

### On the client side: defining how to send the data

#### The action attribute
`<form action="/somewhere_else">`

#### The method attribute

##### The GET method
The GET method is the method used by the browser to ask the server to send back a given resource: "Hey server, I want to get this resource."
```
<form action="http://www.foo.com" method="GET">
  <div>
    <label for="say">What greeting do you want to say?</label>
    <input name="say" id="say" value="Hi">
  </div>
  <div>
    <label for="to">Who do you want to say it to?</label>
    <input name="to" id="to" value="Mom">
  </div>
  <div>
    <button>Send my greetings</button>
  </div>
</form>
```

##### The POST method
The POST method is a little different. It's the method the browser uses to talk to the server when asking for a response that takes into account the data provided in the body of the HTTP request: "Hey server, take a look at this data and send me back an appropriate result."
```
<form action="http://www.foo.com" method="POST">
  <div>
    <label for="say">What greeting do you want to say?</label>
    <input name="say" id="say" value="Hi">
  </div>
  <div>
    <label for="to">Who do you want to say it to?</label>
    <input name="to" id="to" value="Mom">
  </div>
  <div>
    <button>Send my greetings</button>
  </div>
</form>
```

#### Viewing HTTP requests
Open the developer tools.
Select "Network"
Select "All"
Select "foo.com" in the "Name" tab
Select "Headers"


### On the server side: retrieving the data

#### Example: Raw PHP
```
<?php
  // The global $_POST variable allows you to access the data sent with the POST method by name
  // To access the data sent with the GET method, you can use $_GET
  $say = htmlspecialchars($_POST['say']);
  $to  = htmlspecialchars($_POST['to']);

  echo  $say, ' ', $to;
?>
```

### A special case: sending files

#### The enctype attribute
```
<form method="post" action="https://www.foo.com" enctype="multipart/form-data">
  <div>
    <label for="file">Choose a file</label>
    <input type="file" id="file" name="myFile">
  </div>
  <div>
    <button>Send the file</button>
  </div>
</form>
```

### Security issues
- Escape potentially dangerous characters. The specific characters you should be cautious with vary depending on the context in which the data is used and the server platform you employ, but all server-side languages have functions for this. Things to watch out for are character sequences that look like executable code (such as JavaScript or SQL commands).
- Limit the incoming amount of data to allow only what's necessary.
- Sandbox uploaded files. Store them on a different server and allow access to the file only through a different subdomain or even better through a completely different domain.

### Summary
As we'd alluded to above, sending form data is easy, but securing an application can be tricky. Just remember that a front-end developer is not the one who should define the security model of the data.It's possible to perform client-side form validation, but the server can
