## What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team
- I read it in 201
- be yourself, let each other fail, trust each other, communicate


## How I explained REST to my brother
- http: Because it is capable of describing the location of something anywhere in the world from anywhere in the world. It's the foundation of the web. You can think of it like GPS coordinates for knowledge and information.
- The whole world wide web is built on an architectural style called “REST”. REST provides a definition of a “resource”, which is what those things point to.
- A web page is a “representation” of a resource. Resources are just concepts.
- Those URLs tell the browser that there's a concept somewhere. A browser can then go ask for a specific representation of the concept. Specifically, the browser asks for the web page representation of the concept.
- “Web Services” or "APIs" : machines could use the web just like people do.
- HTTP—this protocol Fielding and his friends created—is all about applying verbs to nouns. For instance, when you go to a web page, the browser does an HTTP GET on the URL you type in and back comes a web page.
