## What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team
- It's very hard to track patterns within teams and can vary widely from group to group, There are essentially two types of successful groups:
  - Groups made up of smart, successful people who mostly speak when they are an expert on the topic, very little small talk, highly efficient, time efficient
  - Groups made up of A mix of executives and middle managers with few professional accomplishments, discussions jump around, socialize when the meeting is over
- One key pattern that was discovered is Psychological Safety. Psychological Safety is a key component of collaboration. Amy Edmondson defines this as: a sense of confidence that the team will not embarrass, reject or punish someone for speaking up; shared belief held by members of a team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk-taking.
  - Strong groups are typically made up of intuitive folks, also known as possessing average social sensitivity
  - Group norms are important, so of the two previously defined groups, it's important to be a part of the group that has norms more similar to yours for the group to be successful. You are likely to feel more psychologically safe with a group that has similar norms to you.
  - If you are in a position of leadership within a group, being vulnerable with your group is a good way to build a sense of psychological safety within the group to help others open up.


## How I explained REST to my brother
- http: Because it is capable of describing the location of something anywhere in the world from anywhere in the world. It's the foundation of the web. You can think of it like GPS coordinates for knowledge and information.
- The whole world wide web is built on an architectural style called “REST”. REST provides a definition of a “resource”, which is what those things point to.
- A web page is a “representation” of a resource. Resources are just concepts.
- Those URLs tell the browser that there's a concept somewhere. A browser can then go ask for a specific representation of the concept. Specifically, the browser asks for the web page representation of the concept.
- “Web Services” or "APIs" : machines could use the web just like people do.
- HTTP—this protocol Fielding and his friends created—is all about applying verbs to nouns. For instance, when you go to a web page, the browser does an HTTP GET on the URL you type in and back comes a web page.

### HTTP:
- This tells the browser what protocol to use. It's like a GPS system
- Sort of link GETting resources, but more specifically it's a general purpose protocol for applying verbs to nouns:
- HTTP GET: Systems retrieving information from each other
- HTTP POST: Systems need to add information to another system
- HTTP PUT/PATCH: Systems replacing something in the other system

### REST:
- A web page is a representation of resources
- computers use API and Web Services to share information via a url. Originally all machines in the world didn't need to 'talk' to each other when the internet was first created, but that's different now.
- Data models, like Ruby on Rails
- The introduction of rails enabled a huge boost in productivity.
