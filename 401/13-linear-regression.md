# How to run Linear regression in Python scikit-Learn

`Scikit-learn` is a powerful Python module for machine learning. It contains function for regression, classification, clustering, model selection and dimensionality reduction. Today, I will explore the `sklearn.linear_model` module which contains “methods intended for regression in which the target value is expected to be a linear combination of the input variables”.

- explored the boston data set and then renamed its column names.
- explored the boston data set using .DESCR, my goal was to predict the housing prices using the given features.
- used Scikit learn to fit linear regression to the entire data set and calculated the mean squared error.
- made a train-test split and calculated the mean squared error for my training data and test data.
- plotted the residuals for my training and test datasets.
