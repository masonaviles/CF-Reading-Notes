  - how forms work
    - A user fills in a form and then presses a button to submit the information to the server.
    - The name of each form control is sent to the server along with the value the user enters or selects.
    - The server processes the information using a programming language such as PHP, C#, VB.net, or Java. It may also store the information in a database
    - The server creates a new page to send back to the browser based on the information received.
