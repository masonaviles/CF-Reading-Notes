### Domain Modeling
  - Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model for a specific problem. And a domain model that's articulated well can verify and validate your understanding of that problem.
  - Here's some tips to follow when building your own domain models.
    - When modeling a single entity that'll have many instances, build self-contained objects with the same attributes and behaviors.
    - Model its attributes with a constructor function that defines and initializes properties.
    - Model its behaviors with small methods that focus on doing one job well.
    - Create instances using the new keyword followed by a call to a constructor function.
    - Store the newly created object in a variable so you can access its properties and methods from outside.
    - Use the this variable within methods so you can access the object's properties and methods from inside.
