### Chapter 11: “Color” (pp.246-263)
  - Color not only brings your site to life, but also helps convey the mood and evokes reactions.
  - There are three ways to specify colors in CSS: XRGB values, hex codes, and color names.
  - Color pickers can help you find the color you want.
  - It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast between any text and the background color (otherwise people will not be able to read your content).
  - CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to indicate opacity. It is known as RGBA.
  - CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values, with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA
  
### Chapter 12: “Text” (pp.264-299)
  - There are properties to control the choice of font, size, weight, style, and spacing
  - There is a limited choice of fonts that you can assume most people will have installed.
  - If you want to use a wider range of typefaces there are several options, but you need to have the right license to use them
  - You can control the space between lines of text, individual letters, and words. Text can also be aligned to the left, right, center, or justified. It can also be indented.
  - You can use pseudo-classes to change the style of an element when a user hovers over or clicks on text, or when they have visited a link.
